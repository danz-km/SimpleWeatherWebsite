A very very simple weather website using OpenWeatherMapAPI

[The Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81EuJ5WCyVs)

All you need is Xampp or something similar, a browser, a text-editor and the want to at least be able to accomplish this simple task.

Put the index.php file in the /lampp/htdocs folder (I'm using Arch so its /opt/lampp/htdocs)

P.S Get your own API keys, [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) is free.
